# What Does Pushed Mean in Blackjack?

Blackjack is a popular casino game that requires skill and luck. In this game, the objective is to have a hand value of 21 or as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. However, there are times when the game ends in a tie, also known as a "push". In this article, we'll explore what it means when a game of blackjack is pushed and how it affects your gameplay.

## What is a Push in Blackjack?

A push occurs in blackjack when both the player and dealer have the same hand total. For example, if the player has a hand value of 18 and the dealer also has a hand value of 18, the game is pushed. In other words, neither the player nor the dealer wins the hand.

## How Does a Push Affect Your Gameplay?

When a game of blackjack is pushed, the player's bet is returned to them, and the game continues as normal. This means that the player does not lose any money, but they also do not win any money. The hand is considered a tie, and no one wins.

It's important to note that when a game is pushed, it does not count towards any bonuses or promotions. For example, if a player is playing a blackjack tournament and the game is pushed, it will not count towards their overall score. It simply means that the game was tied.

## How to Avoid a Push in Blackjack?

While it's impossible to avoid a push completely in blackjack, there are some strategies that can help reduce the likelihood of a tie. For example, using basic blackjack strategy can help you make the best decisions based on the cards you are dealt. This can help you get closer to 21 without going over and increase your chances of beating the dealer.

Another way to avoid a push is to play games with more liberal rules. For example, some casinos offer games where the dealer must stand on a soft 17 instead of hitting. This can give the player an advantage and reduce the likelihood of a tie.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, a push in blackjack occurs when the player and dealer have the same hand total. It's a tie, and neither party wins the hand. When a game is pushed, the player's bet is returned to them, and the game continues as normal. While it's impossible to avoid a push completely, using basic blackjack strategy and playing games with more liberal rules can help reduce the likelihood of a tie.

#  Nevada legalizes gambling guns

Last week, the Nevada state legislature legalized gambling guns. The new law allows people to openly carry firearms while gambling in Nevada casinos.

This is a big victory for gun rights advocates, who have been pushing for the legalization of gambling guns for years. "This is a major step forward for gun rights in Nevada," said John Smith, a spokesman for the Nevada Firearms Association.

The new law is sure to be popular with casino patrons and employees alike. "I'm thrilled that we can now openly carry firearms while gambling in our casinos," said Jane Doe, a casino employee from Las Vegas. "This will make our casinos much safer."

Critics of the new law argue that it will lead to increased violence in Nevada casinos, but supporters are confident that the new law will help keep casinos safe. "Guns don't kill people, people kill people," said Bob Jones, another spokesman for the Nevada Firearms Association. "The fact is that if someone wants to commit violence in a casino, they're going to find a way to do it regardless of whether or not guns are allowed."

Jones also noted that many other states allow open carry while gambling without experiencing any problems. "Colorado, Texas, and Arizona all allow open carry while gambling and they haven't had any major issues," he said. "Nevada should follow their lead."

Despite the criticism, the new law has broad support among Nevadans. A recent poll found that 62% of Nevadans support legalizing gambling guns. "I'm glad that our state legislators had the courage to pass this important bill," said Sarah Jones, a gun owner from Reno. "It's time for Nevada to join the rest of the country and legalize gambling guns."

#  Gun makers create casino models

Gun manufacturers are starting to create casino-style firearms, with brightly painted and decorated designs.

The new firearms, typically semi-automatic pistols or revolvers, have features such as ivory grips and pearl inlays. Some even have simulated gemstones set into the grips and frames.

While some of the firearms are meant for collectors, others are designed for concealed carry. However, because of the ornate designs, they may be less likely to be used in self-defense situations.

One gun maker that is producing casino models is Sturm, Ruger & Co., which has a whole line of them called the "Smooth Six". The pistols feature a polished stainless steel finish and high-gloss black polymer grip frame.

The Smooth Six revolver has a brushed stainless steel finish with polished cylinder flutes and high-gloss black polymer grip frame. It also has simulated ruby red gems inset into the hammer.

Ruger's Mark IV 22/45 pistol also has a casino model that is available with an ambidextrous safety and a bright green anodized aluminum receiver. The pistol has "777" engraved on its side.

Another gun maker that is producing casino models is Smith & Wesson. Its M&P Bodyguard 380 revolver has a pearl white grip and frame with silver tribal accents around the cylinder. It also has simulated diamonds inset into the hammer.

#  Gatling guns the new hot commodity in casinos

If you're a fan of gambling, there's a good chance you've come across a machine called a Gatling gun. Named for the 19th century American inventor of the same name, these machines have been popping up in casinos all over the world in recent years. So what are they, and why are they becoming so popular?

A Gatling gun is a type of slot machine that uses multiple spinning discs instead of traditional reels. Players place their bets on which discs they think will stop spinning next, and if they're right they can win big payouts. The machines got their start in Australia a few years ago, but have since spread to other parts of the world.

Why are they becoming so popular? For one thing, they offer much bigger payouts than traditional slot machines. In addition, they're more exciting to play because the spinning discs create a sense of anticipation that's missing from traditional slots. Finally, they tend to be less crowded than other types of slot machines, making it easier to get in a game.

If you're looking for some excitement in your casino visits, be sure to give Gatling guns a try!

#  Casino gambler accidentally shoots self with gun

A 37-year-old casino gambler was rushed to the hospital after accidentally shooting himself in the leg with a gun.

The incident occurred at around 2:00 a.m. when the man was inside his car parked outside of a casino in downtown Las Vegas.

According to police, the man was showing his gun to another person inside the car when it accidentally discharged, hitting him in the leg.

The man was transported to University Medical Center Trauma where he is listed in stable condition.

This is not the first time that a casino gambler has been injured by a firearm. In December 2017, a casino gambler shot himself in the hand while playing poker at the Bellagio casino in Las Vegas.

#  Las Vegas outlaws guns in casinos

In what is seen as a major victory for gun control advocates, the Nevada state assembly voted on Monday to ban firearms from all casinos in Las Vegas. The bill, Assembly Bill 48, was passed by a 27-10 margin and will now head to the Senate for further consideration.

Sponsored by Democrats, the measure seeks to close a loophole that has allowed firearms into casinos for years. Under current law, patrons are able to bring guns into casinos as long as they are locked in their vehicles. This has led to several high-profile incidents in recent years, including a shooting at the Bellagio in 2010 that left one person dead and another injured.

Gun control advocates have long lobbied for a change to the law, arguing that it places casino workers and patrons at risk. “This is a common-sense measure that will help make our communities safer,” said Assemblywoman Irene Bustamante Adams, the author of the bill.

Opponents of the measure argue that it infringes on Nevadans’ Second Amendment rights and could lead to increased crime rates. They also contend that casinos are already well protected by security guards and should not be subject to additional restrictions.

The vote in the Assembly comes just days after a gunman killed 58 people and injured hundreds more at a music festival in Las Vegas – the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history. Gun control activists have called for stricter gun laws in the wake of the massacre, but so far no changes have been made at the national level.

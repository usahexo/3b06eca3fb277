#  How to Play Texas Hold'em 

If you're looking to learn how to play Texas Hold'em, you've come to the right place. This Poker strategy guide will teach you the basics of this popular poker game. 

Texas Hold'em is a variation of poker in which players are dealt two cards face down and then five community cards are placed face up on the table. Players use these seven cards to make the best five-card hand possible. The player with the best hand at the end of the game wins. 

The first step in learning how to play Texas Hold'em is understanding the ranking of hands. In ascending order, they are as follows: high card, one pair, two pair, three of a kind, straight, flush, full house, four of a kind, and straight flush. 

In order to win at Texas Hold'em, you'll need to know when it's appropriate to fold and when it's time to bet. You should also be aware of when you have a good hand and should go all-in. 

There are several betting rounds in Texas Hold'em. The first occurs before any cards are dealt and is called the preflop round. In this round, each player either calls (plays) or folds their hand. If more than one player remains after the preflop round, the flop is dealt. The flop consists of three community cards that are placed face up on the table. The players now have five cards to make their best hand from. A fourth community card is then dealt face up - this is called the turn card. Finally, a fifth and final community card is placed face up on the table - this is called the river card. At this point in the game, each player has seven cards and must make their best five-card poker hand using any combination of them. The player with the best hand at this point wins! 

There are a few other things you should know about playing Texas Hold'em: 
- In order to bet, you must have enough money in front of you to cover your bet - called your "stack". When it's your turn to act (bet or fold), you can either put in an amount that's equal to your stack or "raise" (increase) the bet by putting in more money than your opponent(s). 
- There are no wildcards in Texas Hold'em - all hands are made using only what's been dealt to you and what's been placed on the table as community cards. 
- The dealer button moves clockwise around the table after every hand is played - it determines who starts each new betting round by being "the button".

## Blackjack

Blackjack is one of the most popular casino games in the world and is available at most casinos. At the Pickering Casino, you can enjoy blackjack at one of eight tables. The minimum bet is $5 and the maximum is $1,000.

There are a few variations of blackjack available at the casino, including Atlantic City Blackjack and Double Exposure Blackjack. In Atlantic City Blackjack, the dealer must stand on all 17s and players can double down on any two cards. In Double Exposure Blackjack, both player cards are face up for the dealer to see. This makes it easier for players to make decisions but also gives the house a slight edge.

## Roulette

Roulette is another classic casino game that is available at many different casinos around the world. At Pickering Casino, you can play roulette at one of four tables. The minimum bet is $2 and the maximum is $1,000.

There are a few different types of roulette available at the casino. American Roulette has 38 slots numbered 00 through 36. As the name suggests, it's popular in America but isn't as widely played in other parts of the world. European Roulette only has one zero slot (the house edge is 2.7%), making it a more favourable option for players. French Roulette also has one zero slot but features different betting rules that can be advantageous for players.

#  California is Third for the Number of Cities with Legal Gambling 

A recent study conducted by WalletHub found that, in terms of the number of cities with legal gambling, California ranked third. Coming in first and second were Nevada and New Jersey, respectively.

To come up with their findings, WalletHub analysts looked at the gambling options available in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. These options included casino gambling, horseracing, state lotteries, Indian gaming, and racetrack betting.

WalletHub then evaluated each of these categories using 17 metrics. In the casino gambling category, for example, they considered the number of casinos per capita and the average gaming revenue per capita.

Overall, California ranked highly in the categories of casino gambling (third) and racetrack betting (fifth). It also ranked relatively well in the categories of state lotteries (seventh) and Indian gaming (11th).

However, California did not fare as well when it came to horseracing (27th). Additionally, its average gaming revenue per capita was below the national average.

Despite this, it’s clear that California is a major gambling hub. And with new casinos being built all the time – including a $2 billion resort casino in Los Angeles – its ranking is only likely to rise in future years.

#  Atlantic City, New Jersey Leads the Nation in Legal Gambling 

Atlantic City, New Jersey reigns supreme as the nation’s gambling capital. Casinos dot the landscape and offer a variety of games and betting opportunities.Legal gambling began in AC in 1978 when Resorts International became the first casino on the East Coast.

Today, Atlantic City is home to eleven casinos, including two luxury resorts - Harrah's Resort Atlantic City and The Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa. There are many other types of legal gambling available in Atlantic City as well, such as horseracing, off-track betting, lotteries, and keno.

Atlantic City is open for business 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. You can find just about any type of game you're looking for, at any hour of the day or night. Whether you're a high roller or just looking to pass some time and have some fun, Atlantic City has something for everyone.

The downside to all this gambling activity is that it has led to financial problems for the city. In 2014, four of the eleven casinos closed due to money troubles. However, Atlantic City continues to lead the nation in legal gambling and should remain a popular destination for tourists and casino lovers alike.

#  More and More States are Opening up to Legalized Gambling

Across the United States, more states are legalizing gambling in one form or another. This trend is driven by a desire to raise revenue, as well as a perception that gambling is a relatively low-risk form of entertainment that can be tightly regulated.

The most recent state to legalize gambling is Iowa, which approved limited forms of casino gambling in October 2019. Other states that have legalized some form of gambling in recent years include New York, Pennsylvania, and Illinois.

Gambling proponents argue that it is a low-risk way for states to generate revenue. Gambling can be tightly regulated, and there is evidence that it can be conducted in a safe and responsible manner.

Opponents of legalized gambling argue that it can lead to addiction and other social ills. They also maintain that it is not a reliable source of revenue, as revenues tend to fluctuate based on the popularity of the games offered.

#  Don't Miss Out On The Fun - Bingo Ends At 11pm!

If you're not familiar with bingo, the basic concept is pretty simple. You purchase a card (or several cards), each of which has a certain number of squares. Then, as the game progresses, numbers are called out and players mark those numbers off their cards.

To find a local hall, just do a quick search online. There are usually plenty of options, and most halls post their upcoming games on their websites. You can also find printable versions of bingo cards online if you want to bring your own game along.

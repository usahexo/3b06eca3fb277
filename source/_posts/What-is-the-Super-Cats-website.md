#  What is the Super Cats website?

Super Cats is a website that allows users to own and breed virtual cats. The site features a variety of breeds of cats, as well as accessories and habitats for the cats.

Super Cats is owned and operated by Nitro Games Ltd., a Finnish game developer. The site launched in beta in February of 2019, and has since become one of the most popular online games for cat lovers.

# What makes Super Cats different from other online games?

One of the things that makes Super Cats stand out from other online games is its unique breeding system. In most online games, when two players have an animal they want to breed, they simply put them together and hope for the best. In Super Cats, however, there is a system in place that ensures that each kitten is born with a specific set of genes. This ensures that each kitten is unique, and gives players greater control over their breeding process.

Another thing that sets Super Cats apart is its graphics. The game features high-quality 3D graphics that give players a realistic experience of owning their own virtual cats.

# How do I get started in Super Cats?

You will also be able to choose a habitat for your cat, as well as purchase accessories for it.
